/**
 * Consent withdrawal page.
 *
 * Phase 1 implementation: email-only flow. The user enters the email they
 * used when submitting the /life-insurance lead form, and we mark all of
 * their lifeReferral records as withdrawn (sets withdrawnAt — does NOT
 * delete the records, per CASL/PIPEDA compliance-proof retention).
 *
 * Phase 2 enhancement: token-based flow that emails a confirmation link
 * to the user's address before marking withdrawal — closes the loophole
 * where someone else could withdraw on a user's behalf.
 *
 * The email-only flow errs in the user's favor (easier to withdraw is
 * always better than harder), which is acceptable for May 8 launch.
