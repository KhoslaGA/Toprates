  {
    question: 'Are prescription drugs covered by health insurance?',

  },
  {
    question: 'Do I need separate travel medical insurance?',

  },
  {
    question: 'What\'s covered under dental insurance?',
    answer: 'Most plans cover preventive care (exams, cleanings, X-rays) at 100%, basic procedures (fillings) at 80%, and major work (crowns, root canals) at 50-70%. Annual maximums typically range from $1,000-$2,500.',
