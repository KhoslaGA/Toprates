      "Most personal Ontario auto policies explicitly exclude commercial use, including ridesharing. Uber and Lyft provide commercial coverage when you have a passenger or are en route to a pickup, but the gap — the period when the app is on but you haven't accepted a ride — is your responsibility. Without a proper rideshare endorsement, an accident during that gap leaves you with no coverage and possibly fraud allegations against your standard insurer.",

Your personal policy is typically void. **Periods 2-3 (en route to pickup, with passenger):** Uber/Lyft commercial policy provides full coverage. **Off the clock:** Personal policy applies. Most accidents happen in Period 1, where you have the least coverage. A rideshare endorsement on your personal policy fills that gap and adds $15-40/month to your premium.",

        a: "If you have an accident with the app on, your insurer will likely deny the claim and may cancel your policy for material misrepresentation. You'd be on the hook for damages plus your own car. The endorsement at $15-40/mo is much cheaper than that exposure.",

      {
        q: 'Does Uber\'s commercial coverage replace my personal policy?',
        a: "No — Uber covers you only during specific periods (active rides). You still need a personal policy for everything else, plus the rideshare endorsement to bridge the gap.",

      {
        q: "I only do Uber Eats — do I still need an endorsement?",
